# NeuroVis -- A neuroscience way of visualizing CNNs.

This repository contains a number of CNN visualization techniques specialized for neuroscience research using PyTorch.

Besides the conventional methods such as Activation Maximization (AM) and its variants, this repository also contains methods borrowed from the neuroscience field:
- Feature maps (i.e. neuron activation maps) of each layer.
- Kernel ranking for various rankings such as "orientation".
- Group AM on an entire layer or batches of kernels.
